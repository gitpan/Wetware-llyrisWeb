NAME

    Wetware::llyrisWeb - PM for lyris mailserver support

SYNOPSIS

      use Wetware::llyrisWeb;
  
      dtk_show_query_page($PageTitle);

      show_answerPage($PageTitle, @string);

      &Wetware::llyrisWeb::parse_cmd_line(@ARGV);

DESCRIPTION

    This is the start of how to extend the lyris web front end to solve a
    problem for our list admin types.

    the first two are simple CGI based tricks. The first puts up a brain
    stoopid query page. The submit button will set the
    param('ourInputStrings');

    The second is the response page portion - given @strings to go searching
    through the lyris emaillists for, it will construct the results of that
    query in html and ship it back.

    The third is for command line running on your Lyris Host so that one
    merely passes in at the command line the $tokens that you wish to search
    for.

    TIMTOWTDI

EXAMPLES

    The simple CGI front end would be something like:

      if ( $request =~ /GET/ ) {

        dtk_show_query_page($QUERY_PAGE_TITLE);

       } elsif ( $request =~ /POST/) {

        my $stuff = param('ourInputStrings');
        my @string = split(' ', $stuff);
        show_answerPage($RESPONSE_PAGE_TITLE, @string);

      }

    The simple Command Line Script Would Be:

        #!/usr/bin/perl -w
        use Wetware::llyrisWeb qw/parse_cmd_line/;
        parse_cmd_line(@ARGV);
 
EXPORT
